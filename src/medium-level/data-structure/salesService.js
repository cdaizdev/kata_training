/**
 * Sales Report by Period (Intermediate Level)
 * Real-World Context:
 * In may companies, managers need to see grouped sales reports. Individual transactions are not sufficient; 
 * they want to know how much was sold per month to project growth.
 * Business Rules:
 * Input: An array of sales objects: [{ date: '2023-01-15', amount: 100, status: 'completed' }].
 * Filtering: Only sales with a status of 'completed' should be included.
 * Grouping: You must group sales by Year-Month (YYYY-MM format).
 * Calculation: The result should be an object where each key is the period and the value is the 
 * cumulative total.
 * Order: (Optional but recommended) The final object should display the months in chronological order.
